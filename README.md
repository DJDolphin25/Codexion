Chapter IV
Overview
Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed in this assignment:
• One or more coders sit in a circular inclusive co-working hub.
In the center, there is a shared Quantum Compiler.
• The coders alternatively compile, debug, or refactor.
While compiling, they are not debugging nor refactoring;
while debugging, they are not compiling nor refactoring;
and, of course, while refactoring, they are not compiling nor debugging.
• There are USB dongles on the table. There are as many dongles as coders.
• Compiling quantum code requires two dongles plugged in simultaneously,
one in each hand: a coder takes their left and right dongles to compile.
• When a coder finishes compiling, they put both dongles back on the table and start
debugging.
Once debugging is done, they start refactoring. The simulation stops when a coder
burns out due to lack of compiling.
• Every coder needs to compile regularly and should never burn out.
• Coders do not communicate with each other.
• Coders do not know if another coder is about to burn out.
• Needless to say, coders should avoid burnout!

Chapter V
Global rules
You have to write one program that complies with the following rules:
• Global variables are forbidden!
• Your program must take the following arguments (all mandatory):
number_of_coders time_to_burnout time_to_compile time_to_debug
time_to_refactor number_of_compiles_required dongle_cooldown scheduler
◦ number_of_coders: The number of coders and also the number of dongles.
◦ time_to_burnout (in milliseconds): If a coder did not start compiling within
time_to_burnout milliseconds since the beginning of their last compile or the
beginning of the simulation, they burn out.
◦ time_to_compile (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a coder to compile.
During that time, they must hold two dongles.
◦ time_to_debug (in milliseconds): The time a coder will spend debugging.
◦ time_to_refactor (in milliseconds): The time a coder will spend refactoring.
After completing the refactoring phase, the coder will immediately attempt to
acquire dongles and start compiling again.
◦ number_of_compiles_required: If all coders have compiled at least this
many times, the simulation stops. Otherwise, it stops when a coder burns
out.
◦ dongle_cooldown (in milliseconds): After being released, a dongle is unavail-
able until its cooldown has passed.
◦ scheduler: The arbitration policy used by dongles to decide who gets them
when multiple coders request them.
The value must be exactly one of: fifo or edf.
fifo means First In, First Out: the dongle is granted to the coder whose
request arrived first.
edf means Earliest Deadline First with deadline = last_compile_start +
time_to_burnout.
• Each coder has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_coders.
8
Codexion Master the race for resources before the deadline masters you
• Coder number 1 sits next to coder number number_of_coders.
Any other coder number N sits between coder number N - 1 and coder number N
+ 1.
Reminder: All arguments are mandatory. Reject invalid inputs such
as negative numbers, non-integers, or a scheduler other than fifo or
edf.
About the logs of your program:
• Any state change of a coder must be formatted as follows:
◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a dongle
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is compiling
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is debugging
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is refactoring
◦ timestamp_in_ms X burned out
Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds
and X with the coder number.
• A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.
• A message announcing that a coder burned out should be displayed no more than
10 ms after the actual burnout.
• Again, coders should avoid burning out!
Example of the expected log format:
0 1 has taken a dongle
1 1 has taken a dongle
1 1 is compiling
201 1 is debugging
401 1 is refactoring
402 2 has taken a dongle
403 2 has taken a dongle
403 2 is compiling
603 2 is debugging
803 2 is refactoring
1204 3 burned out
Precision requirement: Burnout logs must be displayed within 10 ms
of the actual burnout time. Allow a minimal tolerance when testing,
as hardware and OS scheduling may slightly affect measured timings.

Timing consideration: To reduce hardware impact on performance
measurements, consider using CPU usage time instead of real-time
clock when feasible. However, for this project, real-time
measurements using gettimeofday() are acceptable and recommended
for simplicity.

Description Coders with threads and mutexes (C)
The specific rules for the mandatory part are:
• Each coder must be represented by a thread (using pthread_create).
• There is one dongle between each pair of coders. Therefore, if there are several
coders, each coder has a dongle on their left side and a dongle on their right side.
If there is only one coder, there should be only one dongle on the table.
• To prevent coders from duplicating dongles, you must protect each dongle’s state
with a mutex (pthread_mutex_t). A condition variable (pthread_cond_t) may be
used to manage waiting queues.
• Dongle cooldown is mandatory: after a coder releases a dongle, the dongle
cannot be taken again until dongle_cooldown milliseconds have elapsed.
11
Codexion Master the race for resources before the deadline masters you
• Fair arbitration is mandatory: when multiple coders request the same dongle,
the dongle must grant access according to scheduler.
With fifo, serve requests in arrival order.
With edf, serve the coder with the earliest burnout deadline (i.e., last_compile_start
+ time_to_burnout).
Note: Due to timestamp precision, equal deadlines may rarely occur
in practice. The tie-breaker rule is required to ensure a fully
deterministic EDF policy, even in edge cases.
• The program must guarantee liveness: no coder should be starved of dongles and
burn out under edf scheduling, provided the parameters are feasible.
• A separate monitor thread must detect burnout precisely and stop the simulation.
The burnout log must be printed within 10 ms of the actual burnout time.
• Logging must be serialized so that two messages never interleave on a single line
(use a mutex to protect output).
• The simulation stops either when a coder burns out or when every coder has com-
piled at least number_of_compiles_required times.
• Your code must compile with -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pthread.
• You must implement a priority queue (heap) for FIFO/EDF scheduling (no stan-
dard library priority queue may be used).
• All memory must be properly allocated and freed (no memory leaks).
Example of simulation run:
0 1 has taken a dongle
2 1 has taken a dongle
2 1 is compiling
202 1 is debugging
402 1 is refactoring
405 2 has taken a dongle
406 2 has taken a dongle
406 2 is compiling
606 2 is debugging
806 2 is refactoring
900 3 has taken a dongle
902 3 has taken a dongle
902 3 is compiling
1102 3 is debugging
1302 3 is refactoring
1505 4 burned out
This example illustrates the sequence of actions for multiple coders.
Note how each "compiling" action is preceded by two "has taken a
dongle" lines, and how the "burned out" message appears at the moment
a coder misses their deadline.

Chapter VII
Readme Requirements
A README.md file must be provided at the root of your Git repository. Its purpose is
to allow anyone unfamiliar with the project (peers, staff, recruiters, etc.) to quickly
understand what the project is about, how to run it, and where to find more information
on the topic.
The README.md must include at least:
• The very first line must be italicized and read: This project has been created as part
of the 42 curriculum by <login1>[, <login2>[, <login3>[...]]].
• A “Description” section that clearly presents the project, including its goal and a
brief overview.
• An “Instructions” section containing any relevant information about compilation,
installation, and/or execution.
• A “Resources” section listing classic references related to the topic (documen-
tation, articles, tutorials, etc.), as well as a description of how AI was used —
specifying for which tasks and which parts of the project.
➠ Additional sections may be required depending on the project (e.g., usage
examples, feature list, technical choices, etc.).
Any required additions will be explicitly listed below.
For this project, the README.md must also include:
• A “Blocking cases handled” section describing all the concurrency issues ad-
dressed in your solution (e.g., deadlock prevention and Coffman’s conditions, star-
vation prevention, cooldown handling, precise burnout detection, and log serializa-
tion).
• A “Thread synchronization mechanisms” section explaining the specific thread-
ing primitives used in your implementation (pthread_mutex_t, pthread_cond_t,
custom event implementation) and how they coordinate access to shared resources
(dongles, logging, monitor state). Include examples of how race conditions are
prevented and how thread-safe communication is achieved between coders and the
monitor.
